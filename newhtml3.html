        <p id="q">Web designers build or redesign websites. They understand what it takes to make a website functional and easy to use, but also understand what is needed to make it aesthetically appealing to the user.

Web design is a rapidly growing industry, as digital media has become part of everyone's lives and people rely on the web for their communications, information, shopping, social life, and more.</p>
        
        <p id="p2">Web designers create the visual aspects of websites. They meet with clients, online or in person, in order to get a clear picture of the message that needs to be portrayed on the website. Once the details are determined, they create layouts, designs, and features that display the client's services in a way that is appealing to the target audience.</p>
   
    
        <p id="p3">The aesthetic aspect is an important one and selecting the appropriate colors, font, layout and images creates the whole personality of the website. In addition to considering aesthetic aspects, the usability of the website has to be a priority — it is important to create pages that the target market can easily use.

For example, a website aimed at children needs to hold a child's attention, and might use bright colors, an easy-to-read font, lots of images, and not too much text. This would make it fun, interactive, and easy to understand.</p>
